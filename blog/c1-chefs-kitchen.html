      The reason I picked DBC is because of the DBC experience. I really like the idea of EQ and teaching us how to teach ourselves to learn. Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social skills are all wonderful components to learn and help you throughout life. I feel as if what I learn at DBC will carry out and apply to the rest of my life. I see my self fitting very well in DBC as the enviroment is excellent for learning and becomming a better person. I am very excited for this kind of learning enviroment because from K-12 years in school. have not experienced anything close to this kind of learning enviroment. I'm super excited to be a part of Dev Bootcamp!
