    If I remember correctly, my thinking style is Concrete Random (CR). The largest part of this learning style that i think applies to me is experimenting to finding answers. I always find my self especially working with code just to experiment until i find a working solution. I feel as if this helps me learn best and understand the code best as compared to googling an answer. Of course I still use google, but that is not my first approach. My approach is to try to solve the answer on my own and then using google if i need help with any particular part of the problem. Like a CR learner, I learn best with trial-and-error, I don't feel as if I have learned material if i'm not doing the material hands on. Watching isn't enough for me.

    My biggest struggle during Phase 0 so far has been time management. I usually have enough time throughout the week to able able to finish the whole week's worth of material but I put off half of the weeks work for Saturday and Sunday. I'm not exactly sure why I do this. I think it's because I am a lot more motivated to get my work done as a sooner deadline approaches. So on Saturday's and Sunday's I can sit on my computer for several hours at a time getting work done with excellent concentration while throughout the week I need to Time-Box my self and take several brakes. I guess as a deadline approaches I feel a lot more pressure to finish everything thus, dramatically increasing my concentration. I need to set stricter rules for myself to be able to distrubute my work evenly throughout the week instead of waiting until Saturday and Sunday to finish heapes amounts of work. I think this won't be an issue onsite because well, there is a deadline every day that needs to be met. I think that kind of environment will suite me a lot better.

    With my thinking style, comes my mindset. I feel as if i mainly have a growth mindset as i love to expand my knowledge in subjects that interest me. I don't believe that intellgience is predisposed or set. Anyone can grow their intellgience if they put their mind to it and i've found that to be true about my self. Before reading the Fixed vs. Growth mindset at the beginning of Phase 0, there were to fixed traits that resembled me a lot. Those traits were ignorning negative feedback and feeling threatened by the success of others (when competeting with them). I always liked to find answers on my own and didn't want help, but when I realized I did this after reading the article, I thought that was stupid. I am a lot more open to reaching out for help now because i realized it doesn't mean im stupid or anything it just means I want to expand my knowledge. I also, realized that I need to accept negative feedback if it's useful, it doesn't always mean that the person is trying to attack me, they have just pointed something out negative that needs to be fixed. When competing with others, I would always feel threatened by their success. I am a super competetive person and always want to be the best or finish first. I am still super competitve but I have kinda toned it down a little bit and don't get upset if someone finds a better way to do something than me. I look at it as a learning oppurtunity and learn from the way that person did it. I really like the idea of a growth mindset and I try to apply that to my life style as much as possible. Failure is unpleasant but once you can learn how to learn from your failures and embrace that, the sky is your limit when it comes to success.
