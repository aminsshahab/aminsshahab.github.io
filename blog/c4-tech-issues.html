    The technology industry in America does not have an equal balance of men and women. Google, Facebook, Apple and other big tech companies released figures showing that men outnumbered women 4 to 1 or more in their technical sectors. The reason for this could be for many reasons. Two that I can think of are, women aren't interested in technology jobs as men, and the tech industry has a hostile and unwelcoming enviroment for women. Women earn about 18% of all computer science degrees in the United States, so thats a big reason as to why there aren't as many female workers as men. That being said, the female work enviroment isn't always the friendliest. Considering, females don't even count for a quarter of all tech degrees, you can imagine that they are prone to very unfriendly and hostile work enviroments. An approach to this issue, would be more women getting tech degrees. If there are more women with tech degrees then the work force will more balanced and women wouldn't be as prone to hostile and unfriendly uneviroments.
