    As of now, i've only had positive pairing sessions. I've felt that I have worked well with all of my pairs but after reading some feedback I realized some people didn't feel the same way. One feedback that stuck out to me was when a person said that I was driving the whole time when I actually thought he was driving the whole time (if im correct about my guess of who gave that feedback). After reading that this person didn't didn't benefit from working with me, didn't feel respected by me, and that he would rarely be happy to work with me again I was kinda shocked. I feel as if I'm being as nice as I can possibly be during pairing sessions (I think this one was a GPS) but maybe some people think otherwise. It was strange because all of my guides have said that I have been culturally on track when I get the feedback email from them.

      The written part of the feedback was short and was nuetral with kidness and wasn't really specific and barely actionable. Kind feedback is feedback that is truthful but said in a nice way and meaningful way, actionable feedback is feedback on how you can improve on a certain aspect with regards with what went down during the pairing session. Specific feedback is pretty self explanitory, it's specific with regards to your kind and actionable feedback, and what went down during the pairing session.

    When reading this negative feedback, I wanted to contact the person who gave it but I have no way of doing so because I don't know for certain who gave me this feedback. If I could I would want to go into discussion with how my pair felt and explain my self, ultimatley improving my future pairing sessions.
