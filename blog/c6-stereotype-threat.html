    I go to a predominently white High School. That being said, I have been a victim  of racism and sterotyping throughout Middle School and High School even though I go to a very liberal school and have a well established social group. I don't think I have necessarily been a victim of Sterotypes threats because the people who have been racist to me, I just entirley avoid while, the other sterotypes and racist jokes that are made about me are made by my close friends and I know that they're just joking and not actually being serious so I don't take offense to it. I'm Egyptian and my parents are Muslim so most racist jokes made by others are about bombing this or that, and well I don't fear that I would want to commit any terroist acts or will ever be in position to. These are such absurd and ridiclous sterotypes that aren't true at all, so when my friends make jokes about them I don't get offended and when others do the same I pass them off as ignorant people.
