    It's hard to determine the happiest moment in your life at such a young age (18). Although when reminiscing about my life and moments where I was happy two values came to mind; music and accomplishment. The produest and happiest moments of my life so far have been when I've accomplished something extraordinary like getting an A's in school work, success in organized sports, and achieving fittness goals. I'm also always happy when I listen to music. Music is a huge part of my life and I listen to it everyday. Whenever I'm not in the right mood, music is always a wonderful remedy to make me happy. I go to a lot of concerts and festivals and some of the happiest moments i've had have been at these kinds of places, most notably Snowglobe Music Festival in Lake Tahoe; my favorite place in the world.
