    I have this very unreasonable, hard to negioate/reason with government teacher (kinda like our own congress) that is very disliked at my school. He often gives us articles and quizzes us on these articles, in which we are allowed to use the articles if we highlighted and annotated them. One day I only highlighted and annotated the front page of the article and he checked me off saying that I could only use the front side for the quiz. So as he's checking other students articles, I am reading and highlighting the rest of the article. He notices this and gets really mad and then decides that I can't use any of the article at all for the quiz. I then got really angered and started arguing with him trying to explain that he already checked me off and that I was reading and highlighting the backside so that I could atleast retain some information from the backside on the quiz. He then decided to not even let me take the quiz. I continued to profusley aruge with him more and he just wasn't having it and wasn't willing to reason at all. During the quiz I calmed my self down and analyzed the problem. I realized that what he was doing was unjustified and agaisnt school policy, so I was looking at a way to exploit the problem. I started writing an account of exactly what happened during that class period with specific times, and quoted the exact conversation we exchanged with eachother. I signed the account and left an empty spot for the teacher to sign, intending to give this account to the admistration. After class I handed him the paper and asked him if he agreed with my written account. He agreed with my written account and then I explained why I was frusturated and told him that he could sign this account and I would take it to the admistration, forcing him to let me take the quiz and use the front side of the article or, he could just let me take the quiz without any admistration interference. He agreed to let me take the quiz. If I could go back, I would try to better explain myself in a more calm and engaging matter, although, my teacher is very frustarting and gets on your nerves very easily making it difficult to do that. I learned from this experience that anyone can be reasoned with, it just depends on the approach you take. When arguing with a person they are probably not listening to most of what your saying, so maybe with my non-verbal written approach, he understood what was going on and was willing to be reasoned with.
