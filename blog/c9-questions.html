    When I first started to learn how to code, I would always ask my cousin questions. I would ask him a question about a line of code thats not working and expect that he knows what the program is suppose to do by just looking at one line of code. I have learned since that your questions need to be really specific because the person whos answering may not know what it's intended to do. You shouldn't expect an answer to solve your issue but an answer to guide you to your solution. Make you have wrong syntax or your using a method incorrectly, then when you look at your error from the terminal you should get a hint as to what kind of question yout asking. Maybe like "Hey I'm getting a syntax error on this line can you help me out?" or, "I'm getting an error with this method i'm trying to implement can you help me out?". Other good questions can be when you have an issue but don't know how to solve it. For example you can be like "Hey I'm trying to write a program to reverse words in a sentence, can you recommend me some ruby methods I can look into as a guide?". Asking this kinds of questions that are specific will help you get a solution, and help the person being asked to understand what your looking for.
