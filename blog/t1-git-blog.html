      There are many reasons to use version control. As copied from a stackoverflow response that i read, i would not be able to describe it any better.
      Made a change to code, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?

      Have you ever: 

      - Made a change to code, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?
      - Lost code or had a backup that was too old?
      - Had to maintain multiple versions of a product?
      - Wanted to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your code?
      - Wanted to prove that a particular change broke or fixed a piece of code?
      - Wanted to review the history of some code?
      - Wanted to submit a change to someone else's code?
      - Wanted to share your code, or let other people work on your code?
      - Wanted to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whom?
      - Wanted to experiment with a new feature without interfering with working   code?

      Version control allows you to do all of that :)

        Git is local version control system, which means it lives locally on your computer. When you make a change to code you can add that change to git and then commit it to save the change. Every time you save your code, git keeps a saved version of it that you can later go back to for any of the reasons stated above, or for any other reason.

        Github is a remote version control system, which means it lives online at Github.com. You should use Github to store you code because it makes life easier especially when working on group projects. Anyone working on a project can have a copy of the master from github and work locally on their computer to contribute to the project. You can then push your changes to github and it updates the master branch. You can also pull the master branch and update whats on your computer locally. Like git, Github saves each change of your code but online. It's nice to have your code online so others can see changes and collaborate on projects. Without git and Github it would be a lot harder to work on group projects and it would probably be a mess. Imagine sharing code with 5-100+ other people and somehow figuring out a way for everyone to work on it. Yikes!
