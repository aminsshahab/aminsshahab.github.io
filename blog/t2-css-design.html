    Hello readers! On today's blog, I will explain the difference between Inline, Block, and Inline-block displays with regards to CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
     Starting with Inline elements, they have a few properties. Inline elements:
      <ul>
        <li> Respect left and right margins and paddings, but not top or bottom.</li>
        <li> Cannot have a width or height set. </li>
        <li> Allow other elements to sit by their left and right. </li>
      </ul>
      An inline element has no line break before or after it, and tolerates HTML elements next to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Block Elements:
    <ul>
        <li> Respect all margins and paddings.</li>
        <li> Force a line break after the block element.</li>
      </ul>
      Block element's have some whitespace above and below them and they do not tolerate any HTML elements next to the.
    </p>
    <p>
    Inline-block elements:
    <ul>
        <li> Allow other elements to sit to their left and right.</li>
        <li> Respect top and bottom margins and paddings, but not left or right. </li>
        <li> Respect height and width. </li>
      </ul>
      An Inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element. When you visualize all of these elements they would look like:
      <div style="text-align: center">
      <img id="block-image" src="../images/mGTYI.PNG">
      </div>

    </p>
