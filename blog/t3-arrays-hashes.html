    An array is a collection of objects. It stores things, kinda like a list. You can store numbers and strings. An example of an array would be:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      array = [7, 5, 3, "Hello", "swag"]
    </p>
    <p class="nothing">
    To access the first element of the array you would do array[0]
    and that would output "7". Just always remember that arrays start from 0 and work in order from the number of elements in the array minus 1
    </p>
    <p>
    Similarly, are Hashes. Hashes are like arrays but have no order in them. instead of calling [0] to get the first element you can assign what ever you want to get the first element. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
    hash = {
    "7" => "swag"
    "hello" => 3452452
    "ok" => "what?"
    7 => "uwgniur"
    }
    </p>
    <p class="nothing">
    So if you wanted to output "swag", you would just do hash["7"].
