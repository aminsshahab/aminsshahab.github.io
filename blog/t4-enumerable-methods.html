    The cycle enumerable is pretty basic. It cyles through the contents of an array. If you have an array, a = [1, 2, 3] and you do a.cycle {|x| puts x}, if you keep on cycling through the array infinetley outputting 1,2,3,1,2,3...forever. Although if you have a.cycle(2) {|x| puts x} it will cycle through the array twice outputting 1,2,3,1,2,3.
