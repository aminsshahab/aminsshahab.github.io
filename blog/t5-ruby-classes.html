    Classes are used for when you have a group of functions that pertain to one problem. Classes create more fludity and elminate unneccessary repition of code by binding methods that are geared towards solving a particular solution. For example if we wanted to create a class for doing things to numbers, we would have functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. 
    <p>
    For our class Change_number we wanna make a function so that we can work with the number across different functions, and that is called initilaizing. So we'll do @number = number in our function initilaze(number). Then with our other functions like multiplying we can access number with @number and multiply it by 2.  
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to use this class though, we have to create an object. So at the end of our class we'll do num = Number.new(5). Then if we do num.multiply it will go to the multiply function and multipy the number by 2 returning 10.
