    Javascript objects are pretty similar to Ruby hashes. Javascript objects are different in the sense that they can contain functiuons. A Ruby hash has key-value pairs like this: hash = { name: "Adam" }, while Javascript can be similiar: var obj = { name: "Adam" };. Both the object and the hash have key value pairs but where it differs in javascript is the function property. With our same object we can add a function: obj.sayHi = function() { return "hi"; } and then when we type: obj.sayHi(); "hi" is outputted.
