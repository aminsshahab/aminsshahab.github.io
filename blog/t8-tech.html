    The idea behind Test Driven Development (TDD) is that you write test code before you actually write any functional code. The idea is that you have to write functional code that passes your tests and this gives you a very specific goal. Once you fulfill the test you write another test and more code to fullfill that test and you refactor and repeat the process as many times as necessary. TDD is one way to think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code and to help you write clean code that works. TDD is a very popular approach and can help you achieve very clean good code because it has to pass certain tests and it really helps you think through and break down a problem.
